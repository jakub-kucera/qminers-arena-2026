"""R2-RB (7 Nov, round 2): R2-M3 (r2_M3_flow_stop_gated.py, below) plus an entry confirmation. CONFIRM_TICKS > 0: after
a fresh big signal (a side change, or the first big order after a stop) the entry waits until the mid has moved that many
ticks the signal's way from the mid at the signal; CONFIRM_MS > 0: and/or until that many ms have passed. While the
entry waits the real target is 0 (a flip's exit half still goes out at once); a big order of either side arriving before
the confirmation forgets the pending one and starts a new one from its mid; a same-side big order after the
confirmation changes nothing. The confirmation acts after the self-gate and the stop, so the shadow, the gate and the
stop's reference (the mid at the signal) are R2-M3's. CONFIRM_TICKS 0 and CONFIRM_MS 0 reproduce R2-M3 to the cent.
_confirm_waits counts entries that waited at least one call, _confirm_drops the pending signals forgotten.
R2-M3 (7 Nov, round 2): R2-M2 (r2_M2_flow_trend.py, below) plus R2-FH1's stop (r2_FH1_flow_stop.py). The stop
(STOP > 0): once the mid has moved STOP ticks against the position since its big signal was set (the mid when the big
signal last changed side, or was set again after a stop), the real target is flat (one IOC at the touch) and stays
flat until the next big order of MIN_LOTS lots. It checks only while the bot holds a position, like FH1's, and acts on
the real target after the self-gate: the shadow keeps following the big signal unstopped, so the gate opens and closes
exactly as R2-M2's does. STOP 0 is R2-M2 exactly (116,620 on round 2's public tape, to the cent).
Round 2's public tape, MIN_LOTS 500 (`--grid STOP=0,2,3,4,5 --grid MIN_LOTS=400,500 --holdout 0.25`, chosen on the
first 75%): STOP 3 130,251 (in 107,499 / out 22,752; 2,052 fills, 282,934 lots, breach 0, max drawdown 17,140 against
19,543, 8 s), STOP 4 127,931, 5 125,109, 2 121,508, 0 116,620; MIN_LOTS 400 lower at every STOP. The stop adds
+13,631, the same as it adds to the ungated FH1 (118,374 -> 132,005). The mirrored public the same; round1.csv -1,242
and the rebuilt round-1 private tape 0, as R2-M2 (the gate is R2-M2's). First trade at 51 s, as R2-M2.
R2-M2 (7 Nov, round 2): follow the big aggressive orders and the minute-scale trend. On round 2's public tape an
aggressive order of 500+ lots moves the mid on by +1.2 to +2 ticks within 5 s (round 1: +0.5), and a move of 8+ ticks
over the last 60-120 s keeps going. Two signals, each -1, 0 or +1:
- big: the side of the last aggressive order of at least MIN_LOTS lots (one call's net market-taker flow), 0 once
  HOLD_MS have passed since it (HOLD_MS 0: never);
- trend: the mean over LOOKBACKS_MS of each lookback's band (+1 once the mid has risen ENTER_TICKS over it, -1 once it
  has fallen as much, else the last), 0 until the lookback has passed.
The target is MAX_POS x clip(W_BIG x big + W_TREND x trend, -1, 1), rounded; with GATE 1 the big signal counts only
when the trend agrees (target MAX_POS x big then, else 0). The position goes to the target by IOCs at the touch (CROSS
ticks through it), one in flight, when it is at least MIN_CHANGE lots away. The limit counts every order that can
still fill, so |position| never exceeds MAX_POS.
The self-gate (SELF_GATE 1): a one-lot shadow holds sign(target) at the touch it sees (bought at the ask, sold at the
bid), and the real target is 0 unless the shadow's PnL since the start is above GATE_TICKS. On round 1's tapes, where
these signals lose (the big orders move the mid +0.5 ticks, under the spread), the gate never opens; on round 2's it
costs about 1-2k.
Round 2's public tape at these defaults: +116,620 (in 95,379 / out 21,241; 1,940 fills, 276,900 lots, breach 0, 11 s);
round 1's: -1,242 with the gate (-157,078 without it). The trend is off (W_TREND 0): blended in, it only lowered the
PnL. Speed matters: at an order delay of 10 / 20 / 50 ms instead of the rules' 5, 111,195 / 91,114 / 38,121.
